# üìú TOME-hnp - Overview

TOME-hnp is a research project focused on the automatic indexing and semantic organization of digitized historical newspaper pages. The goal is to process and structure large-scale collections of scanned microfilm editions using computational methods, facilitating access, searchability, and long-term preservation of historical press materials.

The project explores techniques in:

- Optical Character Recognition (OCR)

- Natural Language Processing (NLP)

- Named Entity Recognition (NER)

- Temporal and Semantic Indexing

- Metadata Extraction and Structuring



## Source Data
The source data used in this project consists of a digitized collection of historical newspapers originally preserved on microfilm reels.

The original materials are part of the holdings of the Biblioteca Universitaria di Bologna, which provided access to the digitized content for research purposes. The collection includes newspapers published over multiple decades and serves as a valuable resource for the study of press history, cultural heritage, and Digital Humanities applications.


### üìå Notes
Due to licensing restrictions and data protection considerations, the following components are excluded from this repository:
- The `img/` directory, which contains excerpt samples of the digitized source materials used in this project
- The `UNIMARC/XML` file representing the catalog metadata of the digitized newspaper collection
