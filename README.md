# üìú TOME-hnp - Overview

TOME-hnp is a research project focused on the automatic indexing and semantic organization of digitized historical newspaper pages. The goal is to process and structure large-scale collections of scanned microfilm editions using computational methods, facilitating access, searchability, and long-term preservation of historical press materials.

The project explores techniques in:

- Optical Character Recognition (OCR)

- Natural Language Processing (NLP)

- Named Entity Recognition (NER)

- Temporal and Semantic Indexing

- Metadata Extraction and Structuring

This work is conducted as part of a curricular internship at the Digital Humanities Advanced Research Centre (DH.ARC) and the ADLab - research centers within the University of Bologna.
